Bunch of functions to sync my AniList and Sonarr.

Few capabilities atm

1. If show is both in sonarr and anilist, put anilist entry in "Sonarr" list. If I have all shows downloaded, add to "Downloaded List"
2. Keep a list of anilist entries, if there are new ones added, find them and add them in sonarr, and tag them with correct season (i.e. spring 2021). If show is alreeady in sonarr, append the new season tag. (will not create tag) (CURRENT FUNCTIONALITY IF RUN)
